This is an IPython notebook done for the cincinnati python study group 
on July 16, 2015.  It's a very brief look at NumPy and OpenCV-Python.

Requires
- Python
- [The SciPy stack including ipython](http://www.scipy.org/install.html) 
- OpenCV-Python. Theres a brew recipe for mac. There are instructions for 
installation on other platforms. Google is your friend here (YMMV).
